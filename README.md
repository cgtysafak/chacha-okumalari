## ChaCha Okumalari

*ChaCha Okumalari* is an Android application that allows me to share my notes on the books I have read. The project aims to build a book blog while having fun and learning more about Android Development. 

This is the User Panel of the project. The User Panel allows users to read everything I have written, but they can not create, update or delete content. Admin Panel version, which is in a private repository, allows these.

## Contributing

As for the initial version of the app, which is the first version uploaded to the Google Play Store, I made it myself. Pull requests are welcome. For significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
